# EDGE_Project_TasniaAfrin_2108050
This project shows how to use a **convolutional deep network** to learn a pre-emphasis filter for speech recognition. Here, a learnable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) layer is used to obtain a time-frequency representation, suitable for use with **2-D convolutional layers**. 
-Random division of data were turned into training and test sets.
-Tested the trained network on the held-out test set.
-Looped over the test set and predicted the class labels for each minibatch.
-Evaluated the classification accuracy on the examples in the held-out test set.
